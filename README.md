# Starting-out
Need a clue
Not sure if this is correct place for this
My trial app runs but not the way i think it should
It can load a file and display it but the 
messagebox is displayed regardless of which button is pressed
and the openfiledialog is displayed twice if cancel is clicked
before the messagebox shows.
Any advice on why and how to fix it
would be greatly appreciated.
Please keep in mind I am a complete novice
with C# and visual studio 2017.
